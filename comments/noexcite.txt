yeah
I'm so sad I didn't go to nando's when I was in manchester
nat
hey I will be back in a minute I need to do something
i find out on monday if I'm gonna be working for them
should've snuck in a cheeky nando's before my flight home
oh definitely, you won't make that mistake again
sounds dangerous jono
tbf it will be since I'm gonna be on the grill, which runs at 300C
ooh good luck jono
if I get the job I'll probably not be around much for a few weeks to a month due to sheer exhaustion
omg yay, good luck jono
but it'll be worth
good luck!
thank you guys
I think I got it, but I don't know for sure
only things that matters is that you are happy, even if it means you being away for a lil bit
^^^
yeah I just need a fucking job
but thank you, I'll just be too tired I think
that's a mood honestly jono
ye do it
or don't
you got this!
you could've done it in 3 seconds ez
git gud gomi
RIP
didn't see that one coming
bet Chris could've done that smh
honestly I just randomly got my job, wasn't much thouyght behind it but having money is a really nice feeling even though I'm never around and never have energy for anything on my days off
BECAUSE IM MEAN
oh yeah same Nat, I just need the work because the unemployment welfare life has been depressing the fuck outta me
and I know work won't be much fun either, but it'll at least be better than this
my job is actually kinda fun tbh. just some long days sometimes because I live almost 2 hours away
I mean if the trains fit I live like 1ÔøΩ hours away but sometimes they don't and it's over 2 hours and then I have no day left
secret block?
IDK
so many smarts
THEY DO THAT SOMETIMES
i wanna buy that game now, but i still haven't finished the marios i bought so i should prob do that first
i like those more than the "open world" ones
there was this haunted mansion i loved in the ds one and i would play it over and over again

eyy welcome
gaming on PC is alot of fun, because we can customize it
yup, there's a lot of mods you can applied to the game
I think at second snake fight when barry betrays you, if you wait for him you will fight else you won't be fighting him, I am not sure though
ahaan, on pc it's much fun, specifically with overlays and stuff
but then It might need a very good specs so that It runs well
I don't Like chris gameplay of this game
yup Agree
are you telling me you can burn bodies with lighter?
and for some reason i am afraid to attempt chris gameplay

im bout to restart my island and start over lol
pff when Isabelle starts terraforming and building an island from scratch, THEN she can talk.
its not bad! walked all day in the rain tho so im glad to be home
Well we could also organize them ON the beach
so when you're ready to use them you know exactly what you have and where

Can we get f in the chat for more storage space
Hey Amy!
danggg
Hey
Hey S1mmy!
Hanging in there. Just back from a sea-side bed and breakfast where I sat out in a lounge chair reading a book to the sounds of the Atlantic Ocean crashing on the rocky shore below.
I'm the best at that can you see colour game.. I've played hundreds of games and still 100%
LOL Naw, not this time on the LOTR. Was checking out a book by Clive Cussler... Treasure
oh I don't know names at all lol im just a perfectionist
What did you have for lunch today?
That looks nice there
what about the straight part by the bridge, before the tree? Is that too close?
Otherwise I like it there
I have to head off, have a great rest of stream everyone
bye
!!!!
bye
bye
have a good one
Speaking of poetic, I did have one poem published. It's been a long time since I've written though.
when I was in high school we had a poem competition and I published one on mental health awareness
Amy you are such a genuine soul
I think it looks good where it is
Good morning! Just a quick pit stop today, unfortunately. I had today off from work but I need to take my mumma bear to a couple of doctor‚Äôs appointments üôÇ
I just got out of bed for the first time today to get food now back to bed while I watch
I‚Äôm so hungover that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs only 3 here so still got some sunlight
hello everyone
hey!
they are really tall lol but they look really nice with that pattern!
or a shell fountain
On the bottom or top
hi
!
hi
!
Hey Dinico!
hi kaelie and lisa!
Hey Lisa, Andrew & Kaelie!
hahahaha
snack break huh
they don't sell for as much yea.. i havent factored in pumpkins, those might be better
^^ I have been eating pumpkins too
i have like 500 spare pumpkins, definitely using them for moving trees
I'm so rich I eat turnips
jk
me too lolol
you got it haha, i was watering them for the first week maybe and they built up so fast
what does it look ike from the lookout
I think it can still look amazing as a simple area
I like them uptop in the trees, but they could be simpler on the lower level. I think it is still good the way it is too.
I'm not entirely sure tbh. Replace the middle pannel with something or idk. Idk if taking all of them away would be good. It's hard to imagine haha
yeah I like it
but again that area is fine as it is too lol
I wish we had lily pads to put on the water hahahaha. It would be so cute there
Lily pads would be so fun! Maybe you could use them to cross the water too, hop on them instead of a bridge
omggg what a good idea!
wait do we have lily pads?! bc I brought it up as hypothetical hahaha
Oooh. I was meaning like just an item on the water not on the land. But that also I have seen that too
Oh yeah. You can take all the time you need. The areas aren't going anywhere and you can always redo things
i was too lisa! but that's a cool design idea Amy
hahaha I meant.. it would be cool to have water items. like to decorate the water like lily pads, not to replace the panels lol. But dw let's move on !!
aaw melba!!!!!!
hi
hopefully she's okay with feet
hello chat hello
hi
!
Hello!
awww muffin lol
she's pickin' her nose omg
shes so cute
yes!!
quantity selection, cliff items... lol way more important than lily padsvillagers with thought bubbles = my mom texting me to call her asap but not an emergency
twitch user ship u sav and ahhhh do you know whos in my campsite today
More mushrooms will spawn tomorrow so skipping them today won't mess things up

Judy stream ‚ÄúHow to be a c‚Äît, I mean, Bitch 101‚Äù
or you were telling Megan she has Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve and Talent

yes yes that is EXACTLY what I meant
I have 2 mushie recipes, I hate balloon farming
You get them from the balloons
not me being scared of angry moogs, remind me to never piss you off

Salutations and good tidings fellow citizens of the interwebs! how be thou's journey?
Don't wanna say it too much since you haven't had the best day but I had a very good day today, first day of uni this year I haven't felt stressed or been close to crying with stress. things are looking up
He didn't! That's why I have to ask!
lol

brain goes vroom, while fingers struggle
again i wanna thank you for being so supportive of me, you don't how much it means to me.

I wish North Carolina would legalize weed
Wanna come w me

there are only 8 states left that completely ban weed
Bonjour Megan!
sending you all the good vibes. I know how stressful moving can be so I hope all goes well
you and I's gift subs are mirrored! it's great.
Arizona is truly Satan‚Äôs butthole
Other Tobey yes
RODNEY!
but also with me being trans. it's very hard when almost everybody misgenders me because I don't pass as male. But when I'm here, I know I don't have to worry about it.
Just Glitch so we don't get confused
lol
my state is one of them... fun.
CASE IN POINT: today (November fkn 4th) it is currently 91¬∞F/33¬∞C and tbh this is on the cooler side for how hot it‚Äôs been this week
Also did lou look like the gnome I sent you like I said on letter? Idk why I imagine him looking like that
I just been doing my dailies on my island and Lobo just started talking to me about sailing to all the abandoned islands but the word sailing was in green...
We're making up for the grief Judy has given to Megan
33c???????? thats the SUN!!!
arizona be like 120f/48c in summer and -20f/-28c in the winter depending on where you lice
live
We love you Toby

Yeah, it's like the pride emotes
Based on K Pop this time around
I didn't have to sub to anyone, but yeah
