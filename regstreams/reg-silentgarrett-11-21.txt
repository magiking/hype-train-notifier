who killed garrett?
Ali
they voted him off
Wait
ohhh
no one
sorry
he got framed
hahahah
he got voted out
alt tabbed for a second
the small stocking for your dog mad my evening
another heartbreak
Ali is gonna get away with it
Alex is brutal
I don't think they're being bad, I think Ali is just being extra good
Alex has highest success rate in Among Us
hes too good at being bad
wtf just happened

Hey dad
yes
hey man hope you have a good day
Hot take: Alex may have the most Among Us wins. But I feel like Mitch's wins are more impressive.
but the real question is who claimed the most kills??
def gart
